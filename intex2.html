				<p>
					“Ugh, you wanna dig into the past? Really? Fine, fine, let’s do this.
					But don’t blame me if it gets messy—things weren’t always fireworks
					and fun, y’know. Some stories start with sunshine and rainbows. Mine?
					Not so much.”

					<h1>1.Once Upon a Powder</h1>
					<img src="images/baby-jinx.png" alt="" />
					<p>
						“Oh, you wanna hear about the ‘before times’? About the scared
						little mouse I used to be? Pfft, fine. But don’t get too comfy—this
						story goes KA-BOOM real quick.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Once, there was this scrappy little runt called Powder. Spoiler
						alert: She’s me, but, like, WAY less fun.” Big dreams, tiny hands,
						and a habit of tinkering with gadgets that never quite worked. She
						thought she was oh-so-clever, running around Zaun with a pack of
						troublemakers, trying to be someone in a city that didn’t give a
						rat’s tail about her.
					</p>
					<p>
						But here’s the kicker—Powder wasn’t a hero or a genius. She was a
						walking disaster. Every time she tried to help, she’d just make
						things worse. And worse. AND WORSE. Until one day… BAM! She didn’t
						just mess up—she blew her whole world to smithereens.
					</p>
					<p>
						Oh, it was a real tear-fest. Boo-hoo this, sob-sob that. But guess
						what? Tears don’t glue the pieces back together. So I buried her.
						Powder? Gone. Poof. Sayonara. And then—ta-da!—Jinx was born. No more
						crying. No more fixing. Just glorious chaos, fun, and a whole lot of
						explosions. ”

					<h1>2."The Sister Who Left"</h1>
					<img src="images/vi3.png" alt="" />
					<p>
						“Oh, but wait! You're probably wondering—"Hey, wasn't there someone
						else? Someone important?"" Ugh, fine. Let's talk about her.”
					</p>
					<p>
						There was this girl—big, strong, always acting like she knew
						everything. Vi. She called herself my sister, and for a while, I
						believed it. She was my everything. My protector, my hero, my whole
						world. She said we'd always stick together, that no matter what,
						she'd never leave me. Lies, huh?
					</p>
					<p>
						See, back when I was still Powder, I thought Vi could fix anything.
						I'd mess up, and she'd swoop in to save the day. But the one time I
						needed her most, when everything fell apart, she didn't. She looked
						at me like… like I was a monster.
					</p>
					<p>
						And then she was gone. Just like that. Left me alone in the rubble.
						And you know what I realized? Heroes are overrated. Sisters, too.

				<div class="people">
					<h1>3."The One Who Saw Me"</h1>
					<img src="images/silco.png" alt="" />
					<p>
						“Oh, and then there’s Silco. The man who finally saw me for what I
						really was. You ready? Because this one’s a doozy…”
					</p>
					<p>
						So, there I was, all alone in the wreckage of my life—no family, no
						gang, just me and my big ideas. And then… Silco showed up. Pfft, of
						course, he did. He was always watching, always scheming. At first, I
						thought he was just some other jerk trying to take advantage of me.
						But then, he did something different. He didn’t see me as a
						screw-up. He didn’t treat me like some fragile little thing that
						needed fixing. No, he saw my potential. He saw chaos—the real kind.
						The kind that makes the world burn, and he wanted it. He wanted me.
					</p>
					<p>
						For the first time, someone didn’t see me as a mistake. He saw me
						as… useful.
					</p>
					<p>
						So, I stuck around. I played his game. The plan? Let’s just say it
						was big. And loud. Just the way I like it. But every game has a
						price…

					<h1>4."The Price of Power"</h1>
					<img src="images/silco-dead2.png" alt="" />
					<p>
						“You wanna know the truth? Fine, but don’t go thinking I’m proud of
						it.”
					</p>
					<p>
						So, there I was, with Silco—he gave me everything. I thought we were
						building something. I thought he saw me. But I was wrong. He wasn’t
						building anything with me; I was just a tool to him.
					</p>
					<p>
						Then came that night. That damn night. I didn’t mean to do it, okay?
						It just… happened. I pulled the trigger, and before I knew it, he
						was dead. I didn’t want to kill him. I didn’t plan it. But once it
						was done, all I could hear was the silence, and the blood.
					</p>
					<p>
						And, yeah, maybe I felt bad. A little. But it didn’t change
						anything. Silco was gone, and I was alone again.
					</p>
					<p>Guess I’m just cursed to blow things up, huh?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="dead">
					<h1>5."The One I Couldn’t Save"</h1>
					<img src="images/Isha.png" alt="" />
					<p>
						This part isn’t fun. It’s a mess—like everything else in my life.”
					</p>
					<p>
						So, after Silco, I thought things would be different. I had control.
						I had power. But I wasn’t alone anymore. Isha came into the picture
						someone who seemed to care about me. She wasn’t like the others. She
						actually listened to me.
					</p>
					<p>
						We… we got close. Too close, I guess. I thought maybe, just maybe, I
						didn’t have to be the lone freak in this messed-up world anymore.
						But in the end, everything falls apart.
					</p>
					<p>
						I don’t know what happened. One moment, we were talking, and the
						next? The explosion. It was chaos. I had to watch, helpless, as she…
						she was gone. I couldn’t save her. I tried. I swear, I tried. But
						nothing ever works the way it’s supposed to, does it?
					</p>
					<p>I always lose the ones I care about.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="dead">
					<h1>6."The Endgame"</h1>
					<img src="images/jinx-dead3.png" alt="" />
					<p>
						“So, you wanna know how it all ends? You think there’s a grand
						finale, a happy little bow to tie up the mess I made? Hah, nope.
						This is how it goes.”
					</p>
					<p>
						You’d think I’d be ready for it by now, right? After
						everything—Silco, Isha, everything—you’d think I’d just get it over
						with. But, no. Life keeps throwing curveballs, and here I am, still
						playing the game.
					</p>
					<p>
						I know how it’s going to end. I’ve seen it in my head a thousand
						times. Maybe I’ll get blown up, or maybe it’ll be another one of
						those moments where I pull the trigger and take someone down with
						me. Who knows?
					</p>
					<p>
						But one thing’s for sure: when it happens, I’ll be laughing. Because
						that’s the only thing I’ve got left. I’ve lost everything. Family,
						friends, my mind—but I’m still here. The chaos never stops. And
						neither do I. I’ll die. But don’t cry for me. I won’t be sorry. The
						world’s just better when it’s a little bit on fire.
					</p>
					<p>
						After all, what’s the point of dying if you don’t go out with a
						bang?
